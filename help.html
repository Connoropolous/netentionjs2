<p>Analyze all physical locations, and the transitions between them, to find those which seem appropriate for a biological organism - measured according to certain heuristics.</p>

<p>Appropriateness of a given environment, at a specific time, for a specific organism (human, animal, or plant, etc...), may be calculated in terms of its needs.</p>

<p>The tool must be easy and free for all people (and possibly animals) to use, modify or improve it.</p>
                       
<p>This tool is equivalent to a universal constitution that can logically grant all beings equal rights to existence - a distributed government that attempts to guarantee ecstatic survival.</p>

<p>Analyzes all aspects of a group of organisms' existence within an ecosystem of demands and available resources...</p>
<ul>
    <li>including all biological and psychological needs which could possibly affect the length and quality of life of a living being...</li>
    <li>including humans, animals, plants</li>
    <li>or abstract entities such as ecosystems, families, organizations, and corporations.</li>
