So I know that Dave Williams discussed our memo briefly with you all (because I actually read the GAT board minutes) but essentially I have been getting a lot of inquiries from new USASpending users and I thought it would be better if Sunlight could act as a kind of pipeline for these users or to at least open up a dialogue between them and yourselves. Most of them are not government oversight groups like Sunlight, but are focused on using USASpending data for something really specific.</p>

For NGOS and other governmental service providers, they might adjust their resources to better complement federal action. Or for journalists it could mean there's something to report on that's relevant to the public. </aside>

						<aside class="notes">A common use case is to look up a contract for a particular product. This is not possible with NAICS or PSC, but can probably only be found by a keyword search. Since the full text of contracts is not available, it's even more important to have a prose description that details exactly what an obligation is for. </aside>

					<h3 class="left">Main Challenges and Barriers to Using USASpending Data</h3>
					<ul class="left">	
						<li>Incorrect or Lack Of Documentation</li>
						<li class="fragment">Errors, gaps in the data</li>
						<li class="fragment">Lack of information <em>about</em> data quality and compliance</li>
						<li class="fragment">Inability to reliably resolve entities using DUNS</li>
						<li class="fragment">Support for further questions, information</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>The biggest issue users cited is the lack of complete documentation for all of the downloadable data. Many pointed out inaccuracies in the current data dictionary as well as differences between the FPDS dictionary and the USASpending dictionary.</p>
						<p>	Poor data quality was also a big challenge for users. When compared to the CFFR, multiple users reported that USASpending had only 70-80% of what was in the CFFR for the last year the CFFR was produced. Setting aside data quality itself, most users suggested that reporting data quality or compliance metrics would help them manage expectations with their products and give them more confidence in the data.</p>
						<p>Aggregating data by entity was a very common task that everyone wanted to be able to do. Based on the current data, this isn't possible to do accurately via the data or website. </p>
						<p>Most users have in-depth questions about the data that are not answered by the site's FAQ. The lack of contact information or response from the site contact form has been very frustrating for them</p>

					<h3>Consumers of this information can also be producers</h3>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes"><p>Many users requested a way to feed information back in to USASpending.gov, such as reporting errors or submitting fixes. They are definitely vested in making it better and more usable. Sunlight alone has built an infrastructure to normalize all of the values in the data. They can also help with disseminationg information about this data, creating tutorials on using it, or publicizing it's uses.</p>

				<section>
					<h3 class="left">Three Easy Pieces</h3>
					<ul class="left">	
						<li>Documentation</li>
						<li>Information on data quality and compliance</li>
						<li>Dialogue</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">These items that were among the top problems that these users faced and are very surmountable</aside>

					<div style="background-color: white; opacity: .85; border:1px solide gray; padding: 35px;"
					<h3>The Proposal:</h3>
					<p>Connect the users and producers of this data<p>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">I propose that the GAT board is in a good position to convene these kinds of users and the producers of the spending data in one place to address some of these challenges. Since the GAT board is responsible for strategic direction, it can set a precedent by engaging the community in the same way the Recovery board has in the past. It could be framed as a meeting, mini-conference or a development sprint where attendees work together to create documentation, tutorials, primers and tools for the data.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3 class="left">Structure</h3>
					<ul class="left" style="clear:both;">
						<li>Roundtable discussion</li>
						<li>After hours social meetups</li>
						<li>Day-long mini-conference</li>
						<li>Development/Documentation sprint</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes"><p>There are a lot of variations this could take. It could be an ongoing series, like a set of social meetups or roundtables. It could be a one time event like a mini conference that kicks off a broader discussion that can take place online. Or it could be a bit more collaborative like a development sprint.</p>
					<p>In software development, people sprint for days on documentation alone. This community has a good enough working knowledge of the data that it could be a great resource for helping to create and distribute documentation, tutorials and guides for using this data.This community wants to help itself, but they need some level of access to the experts. </p></aside>

				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Potential Outcomes</h3>
					<ul class="left">
						<li>Knowledge sharing with those most likely to disseminate</li>
						<li>Community driven documentation</li>
						<li>Guides, tutorials, data dictionaries on using the data and the site search</li>
						<li>Tools for users and the USASpending team</li>
						<li>The beginning of an online home for the federal spending data community</li>
						<li>More informed discussions of spending transparency priorities</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">Here's a list of some possibilities that could results from this. Documentation that is driven by and serves the community. Collaborative guides on how to use the data. Tools for users. Maybe you have some programmers who attend who write a script to parse all the address fields and convert them to lat/long. Or maybe they create a Q&amp;A site like Stack Exchange to host discussion about the data. </aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3 class="left">Potential Discussion Questions</h3>
					<ul class="left">
						<li>When to use different downloadable data</li>
						<li>How to link contractors to subcontractors</li>
						<li>What are differences b/w USASpending and FPDS</li>
						<li>How to increase public interest in spending transparency</li>
						<li>How users can submit data cleaning/fixes back to USASpending</li>
						<li>What are requirements for agency reporting, exceptions?</li>
						<li>How the data is generated?</li>
						<li>Differences between the CFFR and FAADS PLUS data</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">Now, I know that sometimes the requests of the transparency community can be a little all over the map. But the self identified data geeks I surveyed have very specific, practical questions that relate directly to their application. Answers to these kinds of questions are very achievable and go a long way towards building trust and credibility with this community so everyone is operating in good faith as we work toward a common goal.	</aside>
