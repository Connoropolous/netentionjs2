Netention for Node.JS
=====================

Netention is SEMANTIC GROUPWARE that automatically organizes a community of peoples' realities.

It can then interlink them with automatically discovered opportunities that are mutually inter-satisfying - essentially suggesting to its participants how they could realize the desired futures they have described.

Netention is a tool for describing one's current life situation (“is”), and potential future situations (“will be”)  – as linked data objects. A semantic description of a human life can be considered to consist of a set of declarations representing aspects about which one is concerned or interested.  Link the current and desired states of real and imaginary concepts - including people, environments, objects, processes, knowledge, or time.

Netention realizes one’s goals based on their desires and translates them into tangible outcomes in one’s own network.

Netention aims to solve, in general, all resource management and planning issues that occur among communities of participants.  A complete system could conceivably eliminate the balkanization of various separate online services that presently serve relatively narrow subsets of the more general problem.

Netention is under development and is experimental.  Use at your own risk

The term Netention is a portmanteau of the words Network, and Attention or Intention.  It refers to a community's collective abilities.

Don't "search" - simply describe what you want. Edit it at any time later to adjust or improve the description.

Netention works at the basic thought level, to elicit descriptions of "something" that you're thinking about.  Whether it describes a dream (something that you would like to happen), an object, or hypothetical object - it can be fully described and re-described.  

A hypothetical (desired) object can become an actual object, or an abstract concept can become an actual future event, etc.  Fluid and flexible.  The system can then connect your descriptions to others - these are analogous to hyperlinks.  Links are useful because they suggest ways to achieve the implied desired state of something - whether you want to sell something, whether you want to participate in something, whether you want others to participate in something, whether you want someone to donate something to you for free, etc...  

Netention is a system for describing objects, thoughts, places, concepts, times, etc... Create descriptions of reality that consist of data about the state in which something presently “is”, AND statements about your desired or anticipated state in which it “will be” - how you would like it to become - usually involving ranges of acceptable indeterminate values.

Using these two kinds of statements, the system can link any set of objects according to a presence of mutually satisfying statements, like a lock-and-key, or receptor site on a cell.  It can then suggest links (representing possibilities such as transactions or assignments), ranked according to the strength of their correlation. 

A general-purpose semantic-network computer system simulates “described experience” and discovers “possible experiences” to function as a tool for analyzing and optimizing certain qualities of one's existence. 

A semantic concept represents each agent (ex: a human) participating in interaction processes that constitute awareness of and potential to operate upon arbitrary subsets of simulation content. Choice and configuration of interaction modalities may be customized according to a particular situation or adjusted to compensate for sensory, kinesthetic, or cognitive disabilities. 

A network consists of a community-managed P2P decentralized web network to which clients may connect.  Servers could communicate with other servers in various P2P networks such as Telehash, Kademlia, Gnutella, BitTorrent, Yacy, GnuNET, etc...
