http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit

    A pundit (sometimes called talking head) is someone who
    offers to mass media his or her opinion or commentary on
    a particular subject area (most typically political analysis,
    the social sciences or sport) on which they are usually knowledgeable
    (or can at least appear to be knowledgeable). 
    
    The term has been increasingly applied to popular media personalities.[1] 
    
    In certain cases, it may be used in a derogatory manner as well, 
    as the political equivalent of "ideologue."
