Biotic vs. Abiotic, Renewable vs. Non-renewable

Land

Air

Heavy metals 
    including ores such as gold, iron, copper, silver, etc.

Animals

Plantlife and Fungi

Fossil Fuels

    Coal
    
    Petroleum

Water (H2O) - patterns of abundance and scarcity of clean water

        sources
        
            rain
            
            seas, oceans, lakes, rivers, streams, creeks, ponds, irrigation
                        
            underground water
            
            glaciers
            
            ice caps (and their melting)
            
            space (comets, meteors, asteroids, moons)
        
            transpiration / transpiration bags

        applications
        
            drinking
            
            bathing
        
            crops
    
            plumbing / piped water
            
            industrial / factory applications
            
            ...
    
        potability (fresh / drinking water)
      
        salinity (salt water)
        
        precipitation
        
        evaporation
        
        surface and ground water availability
        
        capacity to desalinize sea water
            (which I think could be greatly enhanced if solar energy was used for this purpose effectively)
                
        water quality & pollution
            hydrofracking
            fluoridation
            ...
