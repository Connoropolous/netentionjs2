    Improvement in water supply through a GIS‐based
    monitoring and control system for water loss reduction
    In Ouagadougou,Burkina Faso,a GIS‐based monitoring and
    control system has enabled significant reductions in water
    losses within the distribution of a municipal utility. The
    technical components include leak detection devices,
    pressure and flow control sensors with real‐time and online
    data transmission, automated pressure valves, and an
    intelligent GIS‐based computerized system to steer the
    whole process. Local jobs were created through the
    investment reduction programme. The programme also improved
    water efficiency, water supply and customer awareness of
    the importance of protecting water resources and caring
    for public water supply property.
