	Nutrient objects (the various macronutrients, vitamins, minerals, adaptogens, nootropics)

	Various methods for calculating nutrient density in foods

	Dietary planner linked to methods of obtaining actual food sources, prioritizable by:		

		distance (time and space)
			place of origin
			method of transportation
			freshness (age)			

		quality 
			lack of contaminants, toxins, harmful bacteria, and diseases
				...
			lack of synthetic additives
				food coloring
				preservatives
				aspartame
				endocrine disruptors http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_disruptor
				...
			organic?
			GMO?

			pasteurized?
			raw?
			water and soil quality
				humus
				radionuclides
				fluoride
				...
			fertilizer quality			
			slaughtered livestock's food and living conditions
			insecticide, fungicides
			plant biostimulants

		nutrient density
			for target species (for humans, animals/pets, plants/fungi)
			blood type
			age
			gender
			race
			medical conditions

		lack of specific allergens

		cost
			money
			energy input
			time input

		taste
