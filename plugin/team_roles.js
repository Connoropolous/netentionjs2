"Some people should just start ideas and other ones should carry them out." -Jimi Hendrix

Plant
Plants are creative, unorthodox and generators of ideas. If an innovative solution to a problem is needed, a Plant is a good person to ask. A good Plant will be bright and free-thinking. Plants can tend to ignore incidentals and refrain from getting bogged down in detail. The Plant bears a strong resemblance to the popular caricature of the absent-minded professor/inventor, and often has a hard time communicating ideas to others. Multiple Plants in a team can lead to misunderstandings, as many ideas are generated without sufficient discernment or the impetus to follow the ideas through to action.
Creative, imaginative, unorthodox. Solves difficult problems.
    Weak in communicating with and managing ordinary people.

Resource Investigator
The Resource Investigator gives a team a rush of enthusiasm at the start of the project by vigorously pursuing contacts and opportunities. He or she is focused outside the team, and has a finger firmly on the pulse of the outside world. Where a Plant creates new ideas, a Resource Investigator will quite happily appropriate them from other companies or people. A good Resource Investigator is a maker of possibilities and an excellent networker, but has a tendency to lose momentum towards the end of a project and to forget small details.
Extrovert, enthusiastic, communicative. Explores opportunities. Develops contacts
    Loses interest once initial enthusiasm has passed.

Co-ordinator
A co-ordinator is a likely candidate for the chairperson of a team, since they have a talent for stepping back to see the big picture. Co-ordinators are confident, stable and mature and because they recognise abilities in others, they are very good at delegating tasks to the right person for the job. The co-ordinator clarifies decisions, helping everyone else focus on their tasks. Co-ordinators are sometimes perceived to be manipulative and will tend to delegate all work, leaving nothing but the delegating for them to do.
Mature, confident and trusting. A good chair-person. Clarifies goals, promotes decision-making.
    Can be manipulative and appear aloof.

Shaper
The Shaper is a task-focused individual who pursues objectives with vigour and who is driven by tremendous energy and the need to achieve - for the Shaper, winning is the name of the game. The Shaper provides the necessary drive to ensure that the team kept moving and did not lose focus or momentum.[2]
Shapers are people who challenge the team to improve. They are dynamic and usually extroverted people who enjoy stimulating others, questioning norms, and finding the best approaches for solving problems. The Shaper is the one who shakes things up to make sure that all possibilities are considered and that the team does not become complacent.[3] Shapers could risk becoming aggressive and bad-humoured in their attempts to get things done.[2] Shapers often see obstacles as exciting challenges and they tend to have the courage to push on when others feel like quitting.
Dynamic, outgoing, highly strung. Challenges, pressurises, finds ways round obstacles.
    Prone to provocation and short-lived bursts of temper.

Monitor Evaluator
Monitor Evaluators are fair and logical observers and judges of what is going on in the team. Since they are good at detaching themselves from bias, they are often the ones to see all available options with the greatest clarity and impartiality. They take a broad view when problem-solving, and by moving slowly and analytically, will almost always come to the right decision. However, they can become very critical, damping enthusiasm for anything without logical grounds, and they have a hard time inspiring themselves or others to be passionate about their work.
Sober, strategic and discerning. Sees all options. Judges accurately.
    Lacks drive and ability to inspire others.

Teamworker
A Teamworker is the oil between the cogs that keeps the machine that is the team running smoothly. They are good listeners and diplomats, talented at smoothing over conflicts and helping parties understand one another without becoming confrontational. Since the role can be a low-profile one, the beneficial effect of a Teamworker can go unnoticed and unappreciated until they are absent, when the team begins to argue, and small but important things cease to happen. Because of an unwillingness to take sides, a Teamworker may not be able to take decisive action when it's needed.
Social, mild, perceptive and accommodating. Listens, builds, averts friction.
    Indecisive in crunch situations.

Implementer
The Implementer takes their colleagues' suggestions and ideas and turns them into positive action. They are efficient and self-disciplined, and can always be relied on to deliver on time. They are motivated by their loyalty to the team or company, which means that they will often take on jobs everyone else avoids or dislikes. However, they may be seen as closed-minded and inflexible since they will often have difficulty deviating from their own well-thought-out plans, especially if such a deviation compromises efficiency or threatens well-established practices.
Disciplined, reliable, conservative and efficient. Turns ideas into practical actions.
    Somewhat inflexible, slow to respond to new possibilities.

Completer Finisher
The Completer Finisher is a perfectionist and will often go the extra mile to make sure everything is "just right," and the things he or she delivers can be trusted to have been double-checked and then checked again. The Completer Finisher has a strong inward sense of the need for accuracy, and sets his or her own high standards rather than working on the encouragement of others. They may frustrate their teammates by worrying excessively about minor details and by refusing to delegate tasks that they do not trust anyone else to perform.
Painstaking, conscientious, anxious. Searches out errors and omissions. Delivers on time.
    Inclined to worry unduly. Reluctant to delegate.

Specialist
Specialists are passionate about learning in their own particular field. As a result, they are likely to be a fountain of knowledge and will enjoy imparting this knowledge to others. They also strive to improve and build upon their expertise. If there is anything they do not know the answer to, they will happily go and find out. Specialists bring a high level of concentration, ability, and skill in their discipline to the team, but can only contribute on that specialism and will tend to be uninterested in anything which lies outside its narrow confines.
The Belbin Team Inventory was revised to include the Specialist role, since the role was not revealed in the original research because no specialised knowledge was required for the simulation exercise.
Single-minded, self-starting, dedicated. Provides knowledge or technical skills in rare supply.
    Contributes on only a narrow front.
