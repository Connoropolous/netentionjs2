Beyond the Enterprise: Taking REA to Higher Levels
	https://googledrive.com/host/0BxlqOeaPnXHfSmxpd3ZXRVVMNkE/BeyondTheEnterprise.html

	REA is usually presented as an enterprise accounting model. But it can also be used for higher-level economic analyses, which can connect individual enterprises into larger economic formations. No other accounting model is so adaptable. In this context, it is apt to think of REA as a general-purpose economic ontology.

	The REA Ontology quotes Ijiri as saying "...the economic activities of an entity are a sequence of exchanges of resources - the process of giving up some resources to obtain others." Those exchanges of resources do not stop at the boundaries of a single company. They extend across many individuals and organizations, across industries, regions or the whole planet. And they can be aggregated at higher levels: for example, all exchanges involving an economic resource or economic agent type.
