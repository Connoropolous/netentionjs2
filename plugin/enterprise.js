Common components in most business model definitions
    Core capabilities (assets, capabilities, processes)
    Customer value propositions (products and services, offering, differentiation)
        all value offered to all stakeholders
    Target customer (segments, scope, needs)
    Revenue model (pricing, ways of charging)
    Distribution channel (delivery, channels, promotion)
    Partnerships (suppliers, partners, value chain position)
    Cost structure (fixed and variable costs)
    Control mechanisms used to protect the created values and the profit streams from being reduced by partners, competitors or strong customers
    Objects for transactions to clarify what is being transacted between different stakeholders, as it is no longer limited to products and services

A business model answers the questions:
    How are values created, captured and by whom?
    How are values extracted, controlled and by whom?
