How long do you think it should take to solve a major problem if you are not wasting any time?
Take five minutes right now and write down what areas of your life you could optimize to make the biggest difference.
You know what to do from there.  This is the power of rationality.

Confirmation Bias
    Notice if you (don't) want a theory to be true
    Don't be afraid of being wrong, question the outcome that you fear will happen
    Seek out people with contrary opinions and be genuinely curious why they believe what they do
    How do we make people genuinely curious?  Maybe try encouraging childlike behavior generally?
    If your theory is true every test should come back positive, so don't worry and make a game of disproving your hypothesis
    Commit yourself to which directions you will update on the different outcomes of an experiment before running it
    Be more suspicious of confirmatory results when you do run tests
    Feed confirmatory evidence to others, give them tests to run which you know beforehand are confirmatory
    Agree with people first, before attempting in any way to change their beliefs (but be careful you don't start believing it yourself)

Fundamental Attribution Error
    Critical: make observations, not moralistic judgments
    It helps to be around other non-judgmental people
    Observe your own behavior as a third party: visualize the scene with someone else in your place, ask yourself how others would explain your behavior in the situation
    Increase information about the situation, we are more inclined to simple explanations (e.g. stupid, evil) when we have less data
    Get people to internalize the FAE about their own behavior to take more agency in their lives
    Make moralistic judgments about distant people to increase in-group/out-group effects

Bias Blind Spot
    General knowledge about cognitive biases helps
    Ask other people whether you are biased
    Get people to put themselves into a reference class, don't let them think they are a special case
    Point out biases in others as they occur (planning fallacy seems particularly fruitful here)
    Do not use the word "bias": use "heuristic" for technical folks, otherwise use no titles and deal on a case-by-case basis
    Do not cite studies, turn the results of the study into a story

Anchoring Bias
    If possible, gather actual data instead of guessing.  How much is this a problem in practical life?
    Analyze things longer, don't rely on a first impression
    When making complex decisions, make a list of pros and cons and weight each of them by importance
    Make everyone guess to themselves before anyone in the group reveals
    Possible technique: flash a lot of random numbers in rapid succession, to weaken an existing anchor.  Recency effect would still be in play.  Does this work for qualitative reasoning by flashing nonsense words?  This could possibly be implemented on our native hardware by going into free association.
    Use anchoring and relative evaluation on yourself, e.g. turn a shower very cold and then back up slightly, rather than turning it straight down to the final temperature
    Anchor others in critical situations, like salary negotiations

Representativeness Bias
    If possible, gather actual data instead of guessing
    Consider a wide variety of many different examples
    Skim over examples when reading, stick to reading facts
    Ask other people for additional examples in conversation (although it could be more confirmation as well)
    Give other people examples, especially vivid and detailed ones

Projection Bias
    Critical: be responsible for your own emotional responses
    Ask if something you think about someone applies to yourself
    Hold map/territory distinction in mind, be willing to admit you were wrong about your initial impressions
    Empathize with other people to get them to open up emotionally
    Conditional on sufficient self-awareness, just ask the person if they are projecting
    Point out similarities between the projector and the projectee
    Become the thing that the other person admires about themselves
    Nice people who naively project this onto others are more vulnerable to manipulation

Planning Fallacy
    Make estimates of time to completion, and calibrate yourself over time
    Make your estimate and add some proportional amount of time to it (should decrease as calibration improves)
    Ask your friends how long they think it will take you
    Figure out the reference class of your task, gather data on how others underestimate time to completion for those particular tasks
    Give your estimates to other people, to make yourself socially accountable to them
    Visualize encountering various problems during task completion before estimating
    Tell other people about the bias before asking them for time estimates (maybe - you can always add to their estimate)
    You can be more lazy without much penalty
    Note that others don't expect you to be well-calibrated either, so giving a longer time estimate in a one-shot game is not a winning strategy.  For repeat games, a reputation for task-completion and accuracy could be more valuable.
    Create two estimates, one you actually believe and one you tell other people

Availability Heuristic
    Critical: ask yourself what specific observations are forming your belief
    If possible, gather actual data instead of guessing
    Ask yourself how many reasons you have for believing something
    Don't stop with an initial estimate, keep thinking and looking for more information
    In a group setting, have a policy of someone giving another suggestion immediately after the first is announced
    Tell anecdotes and stories to other people
    You can shift people's beliefs over long periods of time without their knowledge by sporadically mentioning things

Hindsight Bias
    Estimate task difficulty ex ante, and calibrate over time
    This bias only exists ex post, so the above technique should basically fix the problem (unless you subsequently argue with your past self's estimate, but with calibration this should not be an issue)
    Your successes will be remembered, your failures forgotten, e.g. cold reading
    Amplify this bias to make other feel smarter and better about themselves

Halo Effect
    This seems to just be the way neurons function, making it more difficult to correct on a heuristic level
    Notice your positive/negative affect towards something, and state that observation out loud to yourself
    Be skeptical of any immediate feelings about something
    Reduce the affect by using comparisons, e.g. imagine someone even more awesome
    Try to consciously reverse the affect you are experiencing for a period of time
    Ask other people who may be less vulnerable to a particular person
    Try to imagine others as a collection of separable parts, view them independently
    The halo effect is not always an unreasonable heuristic, keep a correlation between features in mind
    Make a good first impression by doing something you are good at
    Be happy, make others feel good about themselves, and contribute positive mood contagion
    Surround yourself with high-status people, acquire all good things and ideas and display them readily

Confabulation
    Trade-off between rewriting the memory upon access, and accessing frequently enough to retain the connection strengths
    Don't take your memory as absolute truth, be willing to admit you can be wrong
    Create objective recordings of situations: audio, video, etc.
    Write down your thoughts about the situation as soon as possible after it occurs
    If possible, learn to identify your internal story-generating process (note: this might serve other functions, so exercise caution if modifying)
    Encode initial memories more strongly using extreme emotional states
    Use Anki or some other SRS program to remember specific facts about situations
    You can create memories in others over long periods of time by telling them stories

Overconfidence Bias
    Critical: this particular bias appears to have significant benefits
    Does overconfidence require miscalibration?  This seems like an emotional effect possibly separable from probability estimates
    Visualize success
    Reflect only on the successes of the past, do not think about failures
    Feel an enormous amount of positive emotions upon success, do not feel shame upon failure
    Have your friends help you reinforce this bias by telling you how awesome you are
    To correct it, make people bet on their beliefs.  Avoid activities where overconfidence would hurt you, e.g. gambling
    Encourage others to start ambitious projects, and take them over already partially-completed when they fail
    Write contracts such that a likely failure imposes very costly penalties
    Prevent others from taking on improbable tasks and wasting their time
