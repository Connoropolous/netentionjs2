Ideation is the creative process of generating, 
developing, and communicating new ideas, where
an idea is understood as a basic element of thought
that can be either visual, concrete, or abstract.

Ideation is all stages of a thought cycle,
from innovation, to development, to actualization.
As such, it is an essential part of the design process,
both in education and practice.

==Methods of innovation==

Methods of innovation include:
    <ref>Graham and Bachmann, 2004, Chapter 3</ref>

*'''Problem solution'''  
This is the most simple method of progress, where someone has found a problem and as a result, solves it.

*'''Evolutionary idea'''  
Evolutionary ideas derive from somewhere else, taking something that already exists and improving on it.

*'''Symbiotic idea'''  
A symbiotic method of idea creation is when multiple ideas are combined, using different elements of each to make a whole.

*'''Revolutionary idea'''  
A revolutionary idea breaks away from traditional thought and creates a brand new perspective.  For example, [[Marxism]] (an evolutionary form of [[Hegel]]ianism), or the writings of [[Copernicus]] (a development of classical Greek thought).

*'''Serendipitous discovery'''  
Serendipitous solutions are ideas which have been coincidentally developed without the intention of the inventor. For example, the discovery of [[penicillin]].

*'''Targeted innovation'''  
Creating a targeted innovation deals with a direct path of discovery.  This is often accompanied by intensive research in order to have a distinct and almost expected resolution.  For example, [[linear programming]].

*'''Artistic innovation'''  
Artistic innovation disregards the necessity for practicality and holds no constraints.

*'''Philosophical idea'''  
The philosophical idea lives in the mind of the creator and can never{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} be proven.  This type of idea however can still have vast residual effects.  For example, the idea of [[eternal recurrence]].

*'''Computer-assisted discovery'''  
This uses a computer in order to widen possibilities of research and numeric possibilities.
