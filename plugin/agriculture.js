What is 'yard sharing or a yard share'?

Yard sharing is an arrangement between people to share skills and gardening resources; space, time, strength, tools or skills, in order to grow food as locally as possible, to make neighborhoods resilient, kids healthy and food much cheaper! The group can be friends, family, neighbors, members of a faith community (or any combination!) It's also been called garden sharing or land sharing. It's a bottom up model that allows people to get growing right away!
