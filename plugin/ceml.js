CEML is the world's first programming language custom-built for bringing people together.

Short scripts define the structure for live coordinated events among people with different roles and across locations.

All assignments and reassignments given in Groundcrew are CEML programs that are submitted via our API and executed on the server. Scripts can result in a text message, IM, twitter, and mobile application-based coordination.

..

CEML has a small number of keywords at this point: gather, tell, ask, and assign are the main four. nab is a variant of gather. takes and offers have a supporting role to provide metadata.
