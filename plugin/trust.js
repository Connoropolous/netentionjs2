from Dan Robles & Helene:

	Here is the panel description that I'm putting together for The Future of Money and Technology Summit in San Francisco December 9.  Funny, we're all chipping away at the same rock.   

	***

	Since the financial crisis of 2008, innovators have been creating new platforms that fill the void where traditional institutions break down.   From education, to media, shared assets, P2P, crowd funding, collaboration, and even social justice; social innovations are populating the scaffolding of a new economy, with increasing density.

	Meanwhile, community currencies provide an excellent representation of actual productivity but they are not generally convertible beyond small groups.  On the other hand, crypto currencies are readily convertible across a wide spectrum of users, however they are not backed by real productivity.  What if new social platforms used future generations of crypto currencies to articulate actual human productivity as a basis of true value?   Could this combination ignite a viable economic model to hedge the erosion of the current system?   

	This panel will explore the things that real people are doing in real time to create an optimistic future that we can all live with.
