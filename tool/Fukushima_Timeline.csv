It was decided that a specific incident (impossibility of water injection by Emergency Core Cooling System) stipulated in article 15, clause 1 of Act on Special Measures Concerning Nuclear Emergency Preparedness has occurred, because the reactor water level and the status of water injection was not confirmed.

Judged that the specific issue (Enable to inject water by Emergency Core Cooling System) based on the article 15, clause 1 of Act on Special Measures Concerning Nuclear Emergency Preparedness occurred because of enable to confirm Reactor water level and situation of injecting water. Reported it to authority etc. at 4:45 pm.

Generation team of Power station emergency response headquarters (“PSER”) began reviewing the AM operation procedure and checking the Vent procedures without electricity.
Restoration team of PSER, during aftershocks, went to the administration main building (entrance prohibited) to get drawings in order to check the model and structure of the S/C vent valve (AO valve) required for Vent and open manually. At the same time, we inquired our subcontractors. From the drawings, we confirmed that there is a handle on the small valve of S/C vent valve (AO valve) and could be opened manually.

Although high and low voltage power supply vehicles headed to Fukushima Daiichi they were not able to drive up to the site fast enough because of damages of roads and traffic jam. 

It was considered to transport the power supply vehicles by choppers of the Self Defense Force, but it turned out that the weight of the vehicles were too heavy to carry.

Then confirming drawings, they started to connect the batteries to instrument panel in the MCR. At the event of “ECCS was unavailable to inject water into the reactor”, a top priority was to understand the status of water injection into the RPV.

Also, as the radiation dose exceeded 500μSv/h (807μSv/h) around the main gate, it was determined that a specific incident stipulated in article 15, clause 1 of Act on Special Measures Concerning Nuclear Emergency Preparedness (Extraordinary release of radiation materials caused by fire explosion) occurred and it was reported to the government offices etc. at 8:36 am.
As radioactive dose exceeding 500μSv/h(807μSv /h) was measured by monitoring post, it was judged to specific issue (radioactive materials abnormally released due to fire disaster and explosion) based on Article15, clause1 of Act on Special Measures Concerning Nuclear Emergency Preparedness occurred, and reported to the authorities at 8:36am.

1st seismic sea wave arrived -

The tsunami caused a number of nuclear accidents, primarily the ongoing level 7 meltdowns at three reactors in the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant complex, and the associated evacuation zones affecting hundreds of thousands of residents.

Many electrical generators were taken down, and at least three nuclear reactors suffered explosions due to hydrogen gas that had built up within their outer containment buildings after cooling system failure. Residents within a 20 km (12 mi) radius of the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant and a 10 km (6.2 mi) radius of the Fukushima II Nuclear Power Plant were evacuated. In addition, the U.S. recommended that its citizens evacuate up to 80 km (50 mi) of the plant.",tsunamiimpact.png,http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-com/release/betu11_e/images/110618e15.pdf,Time line sequence of major events following earthquake to May 15th (Tue) for Reactor 4 to 6 at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station,,10,,

2nd seismic sea wave arrived -

The tsunami warning issued by the Japan Meteorological Agency was the most serious on its warning scale; it rated as a ""major tsunami"", being at least 3 m (9.8 ft) high. The actual height predicted varied, the greatest being for Miyagi at 6 m (20 ft) high.

The tsunami inundated a total area of approximately 561 km2 (217 sq mi) in Japan.
