as linked data objects. A semantic description of a human life can be considered to consist of a set of declarations representing aspects about which one is concerned or interested. &nbsp;Link the current and desired states of real and imaginary concepts - including people, environments, objects, processes, knowledge, or time.</span></p><p class="c2 c17"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>A Network is a community-managed web service to which clients connect. &nbsp;Servers communicate with other servers in a P2P network.</span></p><p class="c2 c17"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Netention aims to solve, in general, all resource management and planning issues that occur among communities of participants. &nbsp;A complete system could conceivably eliminate the balkanization of various separate online services that presently serve relatively narrow subsets of the more general problem.</span></p><p class="c2 c17"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>The term Netention is a portmanteau of the words Network, and Attention or Intention. &nbsp;It refers to a community&#39;s collective abilities.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Don&#39;t &ldquo;search&rdquo; - describe what you want.

Create descriptions of reality that consist of data about the state in which something presently &ldquo;is&rdquo;, AND statements about your desired or anticipated state in which it &ldquo;will be&rdquo; - how you would like it to become - usually involving ranges of acceptable indeterminate values.</span></p><h2 class="c2"><span class="c28">Linking our Stories</span></h2><p class="c2 c3"><span>Using these two kinds of statements, the system can link any set of objects according to a presence of mutually satisfying statements, like a lock-and-key, or receptor site on a cell. &nbsp;It can then suggest links (representing possibilities such as transactions or assignments), ranked according to the strength of their correlation.</span></p><p class="c2 c17"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span>A general-purpose semantic-network computer system simulates &ldquo;described experience&rdquo; and discovers &ldquo;possible experiences&rdquo; to function as a tool for analyzing and optimizing certain qualities of one&#39;s existence.</span></p><p class="c2 c17"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span>A semantic concept represents each agent (ex: a human) participating in interaction processes that constitute awareness of and potential to operate upon arbitrary subsets of simulation content.

This was an effort to work toward the earliest form of &#39;nation state&#39;. In reference to this Winichakul wrote:<br></span></p><p class="c18 c2"><span>&quot;The map anticipated spatial reality, not the other way round. In other words, a map was a model for what it was meant to represent, instead<br>of a model of what was represented.&quot; Siam mapped, Ph.D. thesis by Thongchai Winichakul (University of Sidney, 1988), quoted by Anderson in Imagined Communities</span></p><p class="c2"><span><br>This is why Netention can be pivotal in the worlds development, for the first time in human history this situation can invert itself in that people can now create a map in the present that refers to the physical-actual and which also has the ability to refer both to present emotional states and potential realities which can, through interpersonal alignment of will and resources, be worked toward consciously by consensus-groups. Netention is a way toward the redistribution of power from the current model.<br><br>A tool is something that, essentially, makes a task easier than without it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span><br>A map is a locational / directional / representational tool, and a very important one. It is subsequent to a sense of direction i.e. in which direction one is facing, and depends on one&#39;s knowing where one is. In certain Indonesian cultures this directional sense is honed through the development of language. In one particular culture of the Indonesian islands the common greeting is &quot;Where are you headed?&quot; or, literally understood,&quot;What direction are you going?&quot;, the expected answer is directional and if you could not answer that would be the end of the conversation. This is a way to define the difference between a child and someone who had, at least, reached adulthood- in that an adult is one who has achieved individuation, one who knows where one is, and where one is going, as a willing and capable individuated entity.<br><br>In tests where researchers took ten photographs of an obvious sequence and jumbled them, different cultures arranged them in different ways, europeans from left to right, &nbsp;chinese from right to left. People from this particular Indonesian culture arranged them in different directions depending on the direction they were facing at the time...if facing east: the cards were arranged from outer-front coming towards them, if facing west: from close progressing away from them, when facing north: from right to left, and when facing south: from left to right. </span></p><p class="c2"><span><br>The fact of the hinge being upon language in this example is very telling of what happened in the other two cases, namely the european and the chinese cultures. All of these situations depend upon language, but the difference is that the Indonesian islanders were an oral tradition as opposed to a written language culture, and so their directive sense was dependent on the natural environment, the movement of the sun by day in the first two cases, and the rotation &#39;of the stars&#39; by night in the latter two cases. For the europeans and the chinese, who had developed written language, their directive sense became attuned to the form in which they wrote in both cases; for the europeans - from left to right, and for the chinese - from right to left.<br><br>The point is that this use of language by the Indonesian islanders, as a tool to convey and cultivate a deeply intuitive awareness, is something that is possible now in a new form. This is what Netention can offer, but in a very different way, a way which is only possible given our particular situation here in the present.<br><br>Another point here is that a &#39;map&#39; as most people perceive it, and the deeper meaning of a map as I am intending to convey, is somewhat similar, in its difference, to the sense of direction of these islanders and our sense of direction in the west. We have externalised our felt awareness into written and many other forms. It is no longer our own, it is no longer a felt reality, unimagined and immediately obvious, as it is for the islanders. As a result we need externalities, a compass, a &#39;map&#39; and so on. But the &#39;map&#39; I am pointing at here has little to do with this physical object that we generally understand it to be. </span></p><p class="c2 c17"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>What I am referring to as a locational tool is something with the attributes of both tool, and map. &nbsp;In that it is a tool relating to location and destination, it makes it easier to get from one to the other given that both are known and there is some goal associated with getting from one to the other. But what is this goal? Of course that depends on the situation. Each situation involves intent, movement, reasoning, purpose, and so on. In short a map is not what it is, but what is does, and why it does. What it does refers to an objective reality, why it does refers to a subjective situation, and here the map is the interface tool of the two.<br><br>Chrissi (a beautiful soul I am blessed to be with in this life) &nbsp;just stated that stories are &#39;maps&#39; of the unconscious...I have had to disagree. I know from my own externalities, by having read Jung and looked at story and fairytale through his lense, that these are &#39;like&#39; a &#39;map&#39; of the unconscious, but they are not a map in the same way that stars in themselves are not a &#39;map of the universe&#39; and only become a map of the universe when a physically located conscious individual is using them as points by which to reference their position and/or course of action.
