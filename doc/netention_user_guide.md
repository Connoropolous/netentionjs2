# What is Netention?

Netention is a real-time semantic communication tool for describing reality and potential future realities.

Netention collects a community of peoples' stories, and interlinks them with automatically discovered opportunities that are mutually inter-satisfying - essentially suggesting to its participants how they could realize the desired futures they have described.

Netention is the anti-everything.  You own it -- not them.  Since it's open-source you can spread it everywhere you want.  It's the obvious antithesis to corporate monopoly.  Please realize that now you control and own the internet.  EXPERIMENTAL

It is collective, discernible, and intuitive.

Detail - Link - Network - User Interfaces

Netention realizes one's goals based on their desires and translates them into tangible outcomes in one's own network.

It is predictive and intuitive.

# The portrayal of one's life as an open-ended, revisable story, interwoven with people that they know, and the people that they haven't met ... yet.

Social spheres are not mutually exclusive.

Social media allows for immediate action, thus augmenting risk.

Intuition is fragments ofï»¿ unprocessed data your brain calculates.

Netention is a tool for describing one's current life situation ("is"), and potential future situations ("will be")  -- as linked data objects. A semantic description of a human life can be considered to consist of a set of declarations representing aspects about which one is concerned or interested.  Link the current and desired states of real and imaginary concepts - including people, environments, objects, processes, knowledge, or time.

A Network is a community-managed web service to which clients connect.  Servers communicate with other servers in a P2P network.

Netention aims to solve, in general, all resource management and planning issues that occur among communities of participants.  A complete system could conceivably eliminate the balkanization of various separate online services that presently serve relatively narrow subsets of the more general problem.

The term Netention is a portmanteau of the words Network, and Attention or Intention.  It refers to a community's collective abilities.

Don't "search" - describe what you want. Edit it at any time to adjust or improve the description.

Similar to genetic evolution, memetic evolution occurrs inside and between nervous systems.  Netention cuts across many diverse domain models, facilitating rapid memetic evolution - like an information phase change from solid to liquid.

## Semantic Thought

Netention works at the basic thought level, to elicit descriptions of "something" that you're thinking about.  Whether it describes a dream (something that you would like to happen), an object, or hypothetical object - it can be fully described and re-described.  

A hypothetical (desired) object can become an actual object, or an abstract concept can become an actual future event, etc.  Fluid and flexible.  The system can then connect your descriptions to others - these are analogous to hyperlinks.  Links are useful because they suggest ways to achieve the implied desired state of something - whether you want to sell something, whether you want to participate in something, whether you want others to participate in something, whether you want someone to donate something to you for free, etc...  

## Semantic Storytelling

Netention is a system for describing objects, thoughts, places, concepts, times, etc... Create descriptions of reality that consist of data about the state in which something presently "is", AND statements about your desired or anticipated state in which it "will be" - how you would like it to become - usually involving ranges of acceptable indeterminate values.

## Linking our Stories

Using these two kinds of statements, the system can link any set of objects according to a presence of mutually satisfying statements, like a lock-and-key, or receptor site on a cell.  It can then suggest links (representing possibilities such as transactions or assignments), ranked according to the strength of their correlation.

A general-purpose semantic-network computer system simulates "described experience" and discovers "possible experiences" to function as a tool for analyzing and optimizing certain qualities of one's existence.

A semantic concept represents each agent (ex: a human) participating in interaction processes that constitute awareness of and potential to operate upon arbitrary subsets of simulation content. Choice and configuration of interaction modalities may be customized according to a particular situation or adjusted to compensate for sensory, kinesthetic, or cognitive disabilities.

Psycho-supportive and psycho-therapeutic processes react to changing recognized patterns in data associated with simulated agents
    
1.  providing contextual advice (ex: relevant information)
1.  offering to act (ex: manage another process)
1.  requesting information from humans and computer systems

Although the system may seem to be an "artificial intelligence" application, it would be more accurate to define it as a tool that exhibits "automatic intelligence."  Automatic intelligence software guarantees that humans that operate it will remain in complete control.  This is possible because all state changes result from logically deduced conclusions about the changing conditions in the contents of its attentions (such as computer devices like keyboards and mice).

1.  a human's observed past and present qualities (measurements or annotations)
1.  a human's potential future qualities and opportunities
1.  any quality about any subject=object, including a list of qualities that one may potentially define next
1.  variable-strength associations between concepts, mirroring mental associative memory

An instance of the software starts in an essentially blank state populated with a default schema that attempts to span the known human experience.
    
1.  Categories, Labels, Tags
1.  Icons
1.  Qualities
1.  judgments
1.  emotions
1.  behaviors
1.  activities
1.  goals
1.  containers of unknown information that may be helpful or necessary to specify or determine)

One goal, useful for beginners, is "to learn how to operate \[the system\]".  Humans and the software acclimate to each other in various measurable ways:
    
1.  amount and types of data communicated: human-\>software, software-\>human
1.  activity frequencies and time-spans
1.  mistake frequencies (as indicated by 'undo's)
1.  coverage of employed features (knows which features have been unexplored, and can remind the operator of their existence)

Preferences include:
    
1.  "access patterns"
1.  ..

All concepts are linked to all other concepts (in at least one, but often, several ways of fluctuating intensity).  For example, any visible word may links to its definition, synonyms, and related concepts -- accommodating arbitrary dialect, vernacular, and colloquial language.  In essence, one passively and actively evolves an arbitrarily complex "dynamic ontology" of their experience and potential experiences.

This supports descriptions about any particular or combination of fields or systems, such as medicine.

## Managing Reality

Because the system maintains a neutral 3rd-person model of its operator's experience, one can subjectively model qualitative and quantitative details about anything, including other people -- the same system can care for friends, track enemies, and maintain a corporation.

## Optimizing the Health of a Society or Organization

A model of a society or organization emerges spontaneously and naturally when its participants publicly refer to the same concept.  (For example, one may state that one's role in an organization by associating the concept of themselves with the concept of the organization.)

One's privacy is maintained by requiring explicit permission to share information, such as personal.

Netention aggregates knowledge on a global scale useful for itself and all humanity to increase quality of life, reduce institutional recidivism, maximize efficacy, and minimize human error.

# Maps

Written by InvoluteConduit

"French cartographic practices were aimed at displacing the spaces of aristocratic privilege with a uniform space in keeping with a republican  
ideal: 'the uniform application of law and administration'. "- Michael J. Shapiro, Methods and Nations: Cultural Governance and the Indigenous Subject. Routledge 2004\.  
  
"The map literally re-dimensioned them. From the hierarchical vector of their relation to the capital, to a surface that emanated from their real  
world" - David de Ugarte, Nations to Networks, on the effect of the first maps on Creole communities p.18: [http://deugarte.com/gomi/Nations.pdf][1]

  
This 're-dimensioning' was also what was affected by the first nation-builders of the Austro-Hungarian feudal empire who drew up markations to show specific 'territories' where people exchanged with one form of currency or spoke the same language. This was an effort to work toward the earliest form of 'nation state'. In reference to this Winichakul wrote:  

"The map anticipated spatial reality, not the other way round. In other words, a map was a model for what it was meant to represent, instead  
of a model of what was represented." Siam mapped, Ph.D. thesis by Thongchai Winichakul (University of Sidney, 1988), quoted by Anderson in Imagined Communities

  
This is why Netention can be pivotal in the worlds development, for the first time in human history this situation can invert itself in that people can now create a map in the present that refers to the physical-actual and which also has the ability to refer both to present emotional states and potential realities which can, through interpersonal alignment of will and resources, be worked toward consciously by consensus-groups. Netention is a way toward the redistribution of power from the current model.  
  
A tool is something that, essentially, makes a task easier than without it.

  
A map is a locational / directional / representational tool, and a very important one. It is subsequent to a sense of direction i.e. in which direction one is facing, and depends on one's knowing where one is. In certain Indonesian cultures this directional sense is honed through the development of language. In one particular culture of the Indonesian islands the common greeting is "Where are you headed?" or, literally understood,"What direction are you going?", the expected answer is directional and if you could not answer that would be the end of the conversation. This is a way to define the difference between a child and someone who had, at least, reached adulthood- in that an adult is one who has achieved individuation, one who knows where one is, and where one is going, as a willing and capable individuated entity.  
  
In tests where researchers took ten photographs of an obvious sequence and jumbled them, different cultures arranged them in different ways, europeans from left to right,  chinese from right to left. People from this particular Indonesian culture arranged them in different directions depending on the direction they were facing at the time...if facing east: the cards were arranged from outer-front coming towards them, if facing west: from close progressing away from them, when facing north: from right to left, and when facing south: from left to right. 

  
The fact of the hinge being upon language in this example is very telling of what happened in the other two cases, namely the european and the chinese cultures. All of these situations depend upon language, but the difference is that the Indonesian islanders were an oral tradition as opposed to a written language culture, and so their directive sense was dependent on the natural environment, the movement of the sun by day in the first two cases, and the rotation 'of the stars' by night in the latter two cases. For the europeans and the chinese, who had developed written language, their directive sense became attuned to the form in which they wrote in both cases; for the europeans - from left to right, and for the chinese - from right to left.  
  
The point is that this use of language by the Indonesian islanders, as a tool to convey and cultivate a deeply intuitive awareness, is something that is possible now in a new form. This is what Netention can offer, but in a very different way, a way which is only possible given our particular situation here in the present.  
  
Another point here is that a 'map' as most people perceive it, and the deeper meaning of a map as I am intending to convey, is somewhat similar, in its difference, to the sense of direction of these islanders and our sense of direction in the west. We have externalised our felt awareness into written and many other forms. It is no longer our own, it is no longer a felt reality, unimagined and immediately obvious, as it is for the islanders. As a result we need externalities, a compass, a 'map' and so on. But the 'map' I am pointing at here has little to do with this physical object that we generally understand it to be. 

What I am referring to as a locational tool is something with the attributes of both tool, and map.  In that it is a tool relating to location and destination, it makes it easier to get from one to the other given that both are known and there is some goal associated with getting from one to the other. But what is this goal? Of course that depends on the situation. Each situation involves intent, movement, reasoning, purpose, and so on. In short a map is not what it is, but what is does, and why it does. What it does refers to an objective reality, why it does refers to a subjective situation, and here the map is the interface tool of the two.  
  
Chrissi (a beautiful soul I am blessed to be with in this life)  just stated that stories are 'maps' of the unconscious...I have had to disagree. I know from my own externalities, by having read Jung and looked at story and fairytale through his lense, that these are 'like' a 'map' of the unconscious, but they are not a map in the same way that stars in themselves are not a 'map of the universe' and only become a map of the universe when a physically located conscious individual is using them as points by which to reference their position and/or course of action. And so stories cannot be a map of the unconscious because of the 'unconscious' aspect of that conceptual statement. A map implies a conscious agent located in a space and subject to some change which can be mitigated by their own will.

# Crowdsourcing

Adapted from: [https://deadushahidi.crowdmap.com/page/index/1][2] (removed references to Ushahidi and mostly rewrites all the negative statements in the positive)

Using crowdsourcing tools without doing the strategic and programmatic ground-work is likely not going to work or change much of anything.  One needs a goal or strategy so that data survives, remains relevant, and possibly grows beyond its original purposes[\[a\]][3].   This guide will help you realize the why, what, who, and how of the data you are trying to gather so that you can effectively reprogram reality.  

Connecting objects together is what programmers do... no big deal.  Well now this is available at the user level and the user is the one who creates and pulls the objects. --Matthias

  
What is effective crowdsourcing and mapping?  
  
Careful thinking about how crowdsourced data will advance your goals is essential.  Netention can help clarify the answer to the question: "Why will this data lead to the change I desire?"

  
Netention is only as useful as the data in it.  Good data, clear categories, and continuous quality control will help you achieve your goals.  Have clearly-defined focuses for data collection.  Your participation helps collectively evolve a dynamic ontology towards increasingly efficient and expressive modes for communicating what truly holds our intention and attention.
    
1.  See: Band Recipe[\[b\]][4]
1.  See: Cortexit

  
Without a community to draw from and intensive outreach and marketing, people won't know about your data, and it may be difficult for them to care about it let alone care enough to share their data.

  
Consider populating Netention with data from your communities (and make sure that you participate in at least one and know how to reach them.)  Just because you built it doesn't mean they will come.

[Asset-based community development][5] (ABCD) is a methodology that seeks to uncover and utilize the strengths within communities as a means for sustainable development.  The Postgrowth Institute, Donnie MacLurcan [\[c\]][6]have developed some methodologies too.  

1.  The first step in the process of [community development][7] is to assess the resources of a community through a systematic inventory or through another process of talking to the participants to determine what types of skills and experience are available.
1.  The next step is to support communities, to discover what they care enough about to act.
1.  The final step is to determine how participants can act together to achieve those goals.

# Sharing Community Resources

DRAFT

Adapted from: Berkeley Public Library's [Tool Lending Library - How To Use It][8][\[d\]][9]

TODO: integrate http://faq.freecycle.org/faq/faq/faq\_guidelines

1.  Only residents or property owners of the community over the age of MINIMUM\_BORROWING\_AGE are eligible to borrow items from other members of the community. No more than MAXIMUM\_BORROWED\_ITEMS items may be borrowed at any one time.
1.  Borrowers must register with the community prior to borrowing items by signing and sharing a WAIVER AND INDEMNIFICATION form, which will be visible to all patrons.  This form stipulates that the borrower acknowledges his or her capability of using items in a safe and proper manner, and that instruction in the proper use of items can be provided by their owner.  Registration will be complete upon verification of the borrower's address, or property ownership if the borrower resides elsewhere. Verification is accomplished by presenting the following:

1.  Valid community card, current photo identification, and one of the following: current lease/rental agreement (with patron's name listed as tenant), or current utility bill (with patron's name listed), or current tax bill (in patron's name) identifying ownership of property in the community.
1.  If residence can not be verified any other way, patron must provide a self-addressed postcard. Upon receipt of the postcard by mail, the borrower will share the postcard as verification of address.
1.  Patrons who rent mailboxes must provide proof of residency or property ownership before being granted borrowing privileges.
1.  [Liveaboards][10] also need to provide proof of residency showing their current MFLAT berth rental coding.

1.  All [\[e\]][11]items lent remain the property of their owners. Only the borrower is authorized to use the tools. The borrower shall not permit the use of said tools by any other person except by the express permission of the lender.
1.  The borrower agrees that the community is not responsible for any manufacturing defects in quality of workmanship or materials inherent in any borrowed items.
1.  The borrower agrees that if any borrowed item becomes unsafe or in a state of disrepair, the borrower will immediately discontinue use of the item and unlist it.

THE FOLLOWING REMAINS TO BE EDITED:
    
1.  Loan periods for tools are two, three or seven days, depending upon the demand and type of tool. The borrower agrees to return any borrowed item on or before the due date in the same condition, normal wear and tear excepted, as when it was borrowed. The borrower agrees to pay for the loss of or damage to any tool on loan to him or her. The borrower further understands that fines will be levied for each item kept past the due date. Repeated failure to return tools on time may result in revocation of borrowing privileges. The Library reserves the right to limit the number of tools borrowed and to alter the maximum loan period.
1.  If the borrower wishes to renew the loan of the tool, he or she may do so on the due date by contacting the Tool Lending Library in person. Renewals must be done in person. If there is no one waiting to borrow the item, it may be borrowed for an additional loan period. The Library reserves the right to refuse or limit renewals. Up to 2 consecutive renewals may be made, dependent upon the reserve status of the item.
1.  If a tool is not immediately available for loan, the borrower may make a reserve request to have the tool when it becomes available. Reserve requests will be handled in the order received. If a tool is available, the borrower may phone the TLL and have the tool set aside to be borrowed later THE SAME DAY. If the borrower fails to come for the tool as agreed, the Library may lend the tool to another borrower. No tool will be held beyond closing time. Tools will not be reserved for a future date. Seasonal demands may affect reserve policies. The Library retains the right to alter or suspend any of the above reserve policies.
1.  When tools are not returned by the designated due date, the TLL will issue an overdue notice. If the tools are not returned after the notice has been sent, appropriate steps will be taken to retrieve them, including by collection agency and/or legal action.
1.  The Tool Lending Library retains the right to refuse the loan of any item for failure to comply with any of the above rules and regulations, or for falsification of any information.

# Verification System

(note : another term than verification would be great)

Verified users

A verified user has been tagged positively by at least three verified users. This kind of tag can be also used as a kind of reputation currency to build a trusted network.

Verified taggers

Have created at least three basic tags that have been upgraded to verified tags

Verified tags

Have been reviewed by at least three verified taggers. Unique objects that corresponds to the "good practices of creating a tag"(these practices will obviously be crucial).

Each created object gives or removes a certain amount of points. Each type of action provides then specific points that allows one to progressively access more potential within netention.

This approach can also be applied to a naked mind protocol, rewarding and guiding users.

- Personal tags

Each user can tag another user with a set of tags. To express gratitude, reward good behaviour, comment on the quality of products or services a user provide...

Express that you'd like to meet this person (which can appear as a contract : netention suggests you meet this person as you share interests, both agree, then the system watch both agendas and suggest locations and times).

- Practical tags 

Verifyiable tag or object

A non-verified user can ask to verified user to check up his tag or object by adding this tag. All verified taggers will have access to verifyable tags and can filter by speciality, subject, etc. With a search object defined for this purpose, a verfied user can for exemple receive notifications for all the new verifyable tags in chemistry...

Report tag

Report offensive content, bad tags, bad practices...

Anyone can report, but only verified reporters can delete a user or an object or tag. You become verified reporter when you have reported at least three objects that have been later verified by verified reporters. Or maybe it could be calcualted with a kind of % of relevancy of the report tags submitted.

These tags may need to be more integrated to the ui than other tags as they are useful in any circumstance.

Finally, this system could be seen as a self-organising moderation system that can scale to any number of users without the need of a centralised authority...

It could help constantly improve the quality of the ontology and the good behaviour within the system.

Reference objects

Verified objects that can be used as templates, for exemple, a reference object for chemistry will have all useful fields to add such object.

Another exemple, for events, various templates can be classified as to allow a quick creation of an object already tagged. Only contextual informations will be needed.

[\[a\]][12]Helene Finidori:

I love the idea of data kept alive. Same for conversations... they should be kept alive and accessible. That's why any mapping/resource maping project must be coupled by a pull and engagement mechanism. Look at this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player\_embedded&v=3Q2YgeKbbt4

[\[b\]][13]Helene Finidori:

Where do I see :)

[\[c\]][14]Helene Finidori:

Actually he based his methodology on ABCD. More here:

[\[d\]][15]Helene Finidori:

Seth, Like you did for the orchestra, could you describe in a few words how Netention could be used for a sharing service, what it could enable better than any catalog or regular map of stuff. how the query, the possibilities, contextualizations would be easier etc etc.... Putting yourself in the shoes of a lender and borrower.

---

S H:

whether you want to find or share something away you're interested in the same "types" of things in that given moment.  from there its extra details to clarify your relationship to it

[\[e\]][16]Helene Finidori:

The important thing here is the possibility to qualify the objects. How can we explain this in simple terms, to give an idea of the potential? There's this multidimensioanl aspect taking time into account. Place, shape, volume, caracteristics... that you probably don't have in any other mapping system? We probably need to focus on objects for a start. What are onjects? How can they be described, how can they be related.
