1.  Then they play cards: Twitter-length forecasts (140 characters or less) that represent their best thinking. They can start a chain of cards or they can build on cards that others play. 
1.  A card is an idea about the future. Your first card is either "positive imagination" --- something good that we could do in the future scenario --- or "dark imagination" --- a challenge or obstacle that might stand in our way. If you're optimistic, play a positive imagination card. If you're pessimistic, play a dark imagination card. And if you can picture both positive and dark outcomes, then play one of each!
1.  Check out [the ideas created by other players!][52] Look for cards that really catch your eye --- and then take them one step further, in one of four possible directions.

1.  No way!" If you disagree, play an antagonism card.
1.  "Yes! And..." If you agree, play a momentum card.
1.  "Yes! But..." If you agree, but if you can imagine the idea playing out differently in your field or part of the world, play an adaptation card.

1.  "perfect match" : attempt to match any objects of similar types that have predicate-matched (ex: 3 bike gears ~~ less than 5 bike gears) properties and provide a summary to each object as a reply.  serves as an innocent introduction to more powerful matching algorithms that can be added later.  should prioritize "best" matches first and avoid commenting on poor matches (most \# of properties matched, most "special" properties (inversely proportional to known usage popularity of that property's) )

[][87]

From the post:

\* Anything in the master branch is deployable

\* To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of master (ie: new-oauth2-scopes)

\* Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same named branch on the server

\* When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for merging, open a pull request

\* After someone else has reviewed and signed off on the feature, you can merge it into master

\* Once it is merged and pushed to 'master', you can and should deploy immediately
